Moving around
//Here are the commands I have yet mastered. Remove them as I integrate them into my editing workflow.
W   move to beginning of next word after a whitespace
B   move to beginning of previous word before a whitespace
E   move to end of word before a whitespace
All the above movements can be preceded by a count; e.g. 4j will move down 4 lines.

^   move to first non-blank char of the line
_   same as above, but can take a count to go to a different line
g_  move to last non-blank char of the line (can also take a count as above)

nG  move to n'th line of file (where n is a number)

H   move to top of screen
M   move to middle of screen
L   move to bottom of screen

z.  put the line with the cursor at the center
zt  put the line with the cursor at the top
zb  put the line with the cursor at the bottom of the screen

Ctrl-D  move half-page down
Ctrl-U  move half-page up
Ctrl-B  page up
Ctrl-F  page down
Ctrl-o  jump to last cursor position
Ctrl-i  jump to next cursor position

n   next matching search pattern
N   previous matching search pattern
*   next whole word under cursor
#   previous whole word under cursor
g*  next matching search (not whole word) pattern under cursor
g#  previous matching search (not whole word) pattern under cursor

%   jump to matching bracket { } [ ] ( )
//-----------------------------------------------------
Ctrl-W switch between windows(buffers?). May combined with arrow keys but works
	just fine by tapping it.
Ctrl-W-+ reset splited screen width/height

:set scb! turn on/off synced scrolling

Yank multiple lines
3y to tank three lines or just use V to select multiple lines and y them

Fix indentation
:retab need to figure out what exactly it does, though

:w !diff % -
Compare edited buffer with original file with diff. 

In vi, J (that's shift-j) or :join should do what you want, for the most part. Note that they adjust whitespace. In particular, you'll end up with a space between the two joined lines in many cases, and if the second line is indented that indentation will be removed prior to joining.
In vim you can also use gJ (g, then shift-j) or :join!. These will join lines without doing any whitespace adjustments.
